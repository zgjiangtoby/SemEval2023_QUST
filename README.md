# SemEval2023_QUST

This is the code for the [SemEval 2023 shared task: Detecting the categroy, the framing, and the persuasion techniques in online news in a multi-lingual setups](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2023task3/teampage.php?passcode=6a5411b7a5bcecd3654a611b6b1b667d) by the team ``QUST``:

He is an Assistant Professor of the Qingdao University of Science and Technology (QUST).

The system created with this was the 2nd place in Italian and Spanish on subtask 1, see the public [leaderboard](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2023task3/leaderboard.php)

# Preparation / Requirements

* python 3.9 or above
* pytorch 1.13.0.dev20220730	
* transformers	4.21.0
* datasets	2.4.0
* pandas	1.4.3
* scikit-learn	1.1.2
* tqdm	4.64.0

# To run

1. `Utils` folder contains data preprocessing scripts for each subtask separately. e.g., `train_data_task1.py`is used for the training and dev data in the subtask-1. (**Note that the training and dev data are merged as we implement 10-fold cross validation.**)

2. `train_pred` folder contains train and predict scripts for each subtask separately. e.g., `t1_kfold.py` will train the preprocessed data from above step through a 10-fold cross validation setup. We also applies early stopping and only save the best model checkpoint from the 10-fold.

3. after training, the prediction scripts is combining the top 3 best checkpoints to make a average ensemble for the test data. e.g., 't1_pred.py' will load the top 3 best checkpoint (the selection of the top 3 checkpoints are made manually by checking the training log once the training phase is done), and generate the prediction `.txt` file for each language in each subtask.
