finalized by their duma for another couple of days once that happens watch out they will no longer be bound by the rules of a special military operation as for them they will be defending their own

to pose with zelensky hesitant on ukraine membership brussels  ukraine is one of us it is marching toward a european future the future of europe is in fact the future of ukraine these are the messages top european union officials have delivered since russia launched its fullscale invasion and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky pleaded for a fast track to membership but ahead of an eu summit on the issue this month these messages look increasingly at odds with where member states actually stand it is not yet clear if the  eu countries will grant ukraine candidate status  an early step on the long path to membership  or some sort of symbolic precandidate status diplomats said what seems certain is that ukraine as it fights for its life will be let down while several eu officials lawmakers and leaders have pressed to expedite kyivs bid others have tried to temper ukrainian expectations stressing that membership might be decades away in private conversations some eu diplomats conceded that their governments are nervous about starting the accession process with a country at war a few wondered if ukraine had a shot at joining at all zelensky on friday urged the eu to pull his country out of the gray area between europe and russia granting ukraine candidate status would prove that words about the longing of the ukrainian people to be a part of the european family are not just words he said in a virtual address to the copenhagen democracy summit the gap between the fullthroated support from top eu officials as they pose for pictures with zelensky and the quiet skepticism of many eu diplomats hangs over preparations for the blocs june  summit  and has not gone unnoticed by kyiv none of the  would say right in the face of the president no but what is happening behind the scenes is clear willingness to put obstacles into the process olha stefanishyna ukraines deputy prime minister for european and euroatlantic integration of ukraine said on a visit to brussels if it joined ukraine would become the fifthmostpopulous eu nation and also by far the poorest drawing subsidies from the rest of the bloc its per capita gross domestic product last year was  the current poorest eu country bulgaria stood at  according to estimates from the international monetary fund the european commission the blocs executive arm is expected to deliver a recommendation on ukraines status next week eu diplomats said the commission may recommend candidate status but with conditions attached  a compromise unlikely to please ukraine since the decision is ultimately up to member states stefanishyna and other ukrainian officials have been touring european capitals to make the case that ukraine needs and deserves candidate status without conditions the starting point for any discussion is the legal status of ukraine she said the debate about ukraines bid threatens to open a split between the country and its european backers dealing a blow to kyivs aspirations to break free from russias grasp and integrate more tightly with its neighbors to the west it also risks further fracturing european unity on assistance for ukraine exacerbating tensions between central european countries and baltic states on one side which support ukraines swift candidacy to the eu and western europeans who tend to harbor more reservations about ukraines readiness this is a country at war and they need a morale boost latvian foreign minister edgars rinkevics said in an interview i can imagine what the russian propaganda is going to do with it witold waszczykowski a former polish foreign minister who is now a member of the european parliament said the eu must do whatever it can for ukraine including granting candidate status we understand that we are next he said if ukraine collapses russia will be the winner and it will go further west stefanishyna said ukrainian officials are working to persuade the holdouts including some nordic countries the netherlands and germany in a visit to kyiv last month german foreign minister annalena baerbock stressed that there is no shortcut to membership privately german leaders have expressed concern that if they open membership talks with ukraine now zelensky by august will be demanding to be let in immediately though the process typically takes years officials familiar with their position said but the german government has not offered an official view on whether ukraine should be offered candidate status soon the formal position of germany is that they dont have a formal position so far stefanishyna said we treat that as a positive signal joining the eu is grindingly complex a prospective members entire body of laws must be picked over and brought into compliance with standards set in brussels the bloc is also well aware that it has far more leverage before a country joins than afterward once a country is in its much harder to influence democratic commitments  as backsliding among some eu members has made clear for ukraine decades of corruption present a problem the country ranked  out of  countries in transparency internationals  corruption perceptions index though ukrainian leaders stress progress on this front several eu diplomats said their governments remain concerned ukraine wasnt close before and it is not close now said one eu diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations but if enlargement is not a direct option what do you do in a speech to mark europe day last month french president emmanuel macron tried to answer that question sketching his vision of a european political community that would include an outer circle of democracies that want to be part of the eu  like ukraine and even britain after it chose to leave we feel in our heart that ukraine through its fight and its courage is already today a member of our europe of our family and of our union macron said we all know perfectly well that the process allowing them to join would take several years  in truth probably several decades he continued that is the truth unless we decide to lower the standards of this accession and therefore completely rethink the unity of our europe macrons proposal hasnt received a warm reaction within the eu and ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba rejected it outright he called out unnamed eu capitals saying their strategic ambiguity on ukraines status has emboldened putin we do not need surrogates for eu candidate status that show secondclass treatment of ukraine and hurt feelings of ukrainians he tweeted enlargement skeptics are quick to point out that other countries are ahead in line serbia montenegro north macedonia albania and bosnia have all been in membership talks with the eu for years turkey applied in  and formally remains a candidate even if it has largely given up some policymakers and diplomats acknowledge that ukraine stands apart because of the urgency of its situation but they still are leery of alienating countries that applied earlier ukraine has been pushing for years to further integrate with the eu and a freetrade agreement is already in place but it formally applied for membership on feb  four days after russias invasion on march  zelensky delivered a virtual address to an extraordinary session of the european parliament speaking from a bunker in kyiv as russian forces pressed into ukraine he said his country was not only fighting for survival but also to be equal members of europe prove that you are with us he challenged the speech landed with force an eu interpreter was so moved by zelenskys evocation of the shelling of kharkiv that he momentarily lost his composure by the time the ukrainian president finished speaking the audience was on its feet at a march summit in versailles outside paris eu leaders were more tentative hours of debate yielded a statement that the european council acknowledged the european aspirations and the european choice of ukraine and would task officials in brussels with providing an assessment european commission president ursula von der leyen regularly touts the countrys european future in a visit to kyiv in april she handed zelensky a questionnaire that marks the first stage of the candidacy process and offered words of support dear volodymyr my message today is clear ukraine belongs in the european family she said this is where your path toward the european union begins in brussels several eu diplomats said von der leyen had overpromised either because she misjudged the mood among member states or because she hoped to nudge them forward more than one diplomat put the odds of candidate status at  a few were more skeptical predicting a halfstep such as the promise of candidate status at some point in the future so long as

congress to pass legislation banning these weapons of war these assault rifles that are being used to murder children in classrooms and create hundreds of mass casualty events already this year and thats getting worse the same reason we cant pass legislation to for example to reinstate the ban on assault weapons is the same reason that we cant pass climate legislation we have the minority

permanent us national security state has been absolutely corrupted by absolute power when the cold war ended and the us emerged as a unipolar hegemon the managers of empire started to believe were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality thats hubris at best psychosis at worst they started to think they could get away with just about anything such delusions of grandeur unleashed a feeding frenzy among those who gorge themselves at the militaryindustrialcomplex trough corruption and incompetence danced off together in a selfreinforcing positive feedback loop nobody had to worry much about the realworld consequences of bad decisions because we lived in our own reality of apparent omnipotence but us policy has been so conspicuously selfdestructive that its hard not to wonder whether it might be intentional could some hostile power have taken over the american brain and driven the nation to selfdestruction the way toxoplasmosis parasites take over the brains of mice and make them fall in love with cats the nation poised to gain the most from selfdefeating us policies is china whoever decided to export american manufacturing to china then waste more than  trillion

united states secretary of energy jennifer granholm told reuters that president joe biden was considering extending the release of oil from americas emergency stockpiles the strategic petroleum reserve spr through october and thus beyond the date when the program had been set to end but then a few hours later an official with the department of energy called reuters and contradicted granholm saying that the white house was not in fact considering more spr releases five days later the white house said it was considering refilling the spr thereby proposing to do the exact opposite of what granholm had proposed the confusion around the biden administrations petroleum policy was cleared up yesterday after a senior official revealed that the white house had made a secret offer to buy up to  million barrels of opec oil to replenish the spr in exchange for opec not cutting oil production the official said the white house wanted to reassure opec that the us wont leave them hanging dry the fact that this offer was made through the white house not the department of energy may explain why a representative of the department called reuters to take back the remarks of granholm who has shown herself to be outoftheloop and at a loss for words relating to key administration decisions relating to oil and gas production the revelation poses political risks for democrats who in the spring of  killed a proposal by president donald trump to replenish the spr with oil from american producers not opec ones and at a price of  a barrel not the  a barrel that the biden white house promised to opec at the time trump was seeking to stabilize the american oil industry after the  pandemic massively reduced oil demand trump and congressional republicans proposed spending  billion to fill the spr senate democratic leader chuck schumer successfully defeated the proposal and later bragged that his party had blocked a bailout for big oil even normally strong boosters of the biden white house viewed the democrats opposition to refilling the spr as a major blunder that decision noted bloomberg effectively cost the us billions in potential profits and meant biden had tens of millions of fewer barrels at his disposal with which to counter price surges moreover observed bloomberg it will take significantly more oil today to fill the spr than it would have two years ago in spring  the spr contained  million barrels out of a capacity of  million now the reserve is below  million barrels its lowest level in  years the decision looks even worse in light of the decision by opec today to cut production which will increase oil prices the biden administration in recent days has been pulling out the stops trying to persuade saudi arabia and other opec members a group that includes russia to maintain todays levels of oil production last friday the biden administration sought a  delay in a civil court proceeding over whether saudi arabias crown prince mohammed bin salman should have sovereign immunity for the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi for which bin salman has taken responsibility the behavior by the biden white house displays a willingness to sacrifice americas commitment to human rights for the presidents shortterm political needs instead of pleading with opec to maintain or increase high levels of oil production the biden administration could have simply allowed for expanded domestic oil production instead biden has issued fewer leases for onshore and offshore oil production than any president since world war ii as such the pleadings by biden and administration officials have backfired the perception of the us in the minds of opec members has weakened while the influence of russian president vladimir putin has strengthened why is that why did the biden administration decide to spend so much political capital trying and failing to get saudi arabia and other opec members to expand production when it could have simply expanded oil production domestically what exactly is going on"}, {"id": "3153", "text": "boris johnson to be removed from history former prime minister boris johnson is not only to be removed from grant shapps

that they are also draining the sun of its own energy possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming scientists at the wyoming institute of technology a privatelyowned think tank located in cheyenne wyoming discovered that energy radiated from the sun isnt merely captured in solar panels but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels in a process they refer to as forced photovoltaic drainage put into laymens terms the solar panels capture the suns energy but pull on the sun over time forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing wit claims in a scientific white paper published on wednesday imagine a waterfall dumping water but you arent catching the water in buckets but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner eventually youre going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely wit is adamant that theres no immediate danger however currently solar panels are an

with panels wed start seeing very serious problems over time if every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years

obstacle to peace between ukraine and russia the ukrainian leader is dangerous as hes ready to sacrifice his people to stay in power angelo dorsi claims ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky is the main obstacle to peace between his country and russia renowned italian journalist and historian angelo dorsi has told rt dorsi has been left disappointed by the coverage of the ukrainian conflict in the western media including in his home country of italy in march he refused to continue cooperating with major newspaper la stampa after it used a photo of the aftermath of a missile attack on donetsk by the kiev forces to illustrate a headlining article bout about russian strikes in western ukraine the paper has reached the bottom of journalistic dishonesty with this move dorsi insisted in one of the interviews the veteran journalist rejects attempts to portray zelensky as a hero warning that the ukrainian leader is actually a very dangerous character in my opinion zelensky now represents the biggest obstacle to achieving peace because it seems obvious to me that hes is ready to sacrifice his country and his people in order to stay in power dorsi said the ukrainian president is absolutely preventing any diplomatic solution any peace talks and hes proven it many times he added russian and ukrainian delegations of various levels have held several rounds of peace negotiations since the outbreak of the fighting but there have been no facetoface meetings since late march when the sides met in istanbul turkey although russia says the talks continue every day via videolink moscow was initially optimistic about the outcome of the istanbul talks but later blamed kiev for backtracking on the agreements that had been reached there on wednesday russias foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said that moscow has lost all trust in ukrainian negotiators adding that it was the reason why the differences between the neighbors kept being settled on the ground on april  zelensky issued an ultimatum to russia the president of ukraine said that if russian troops destroyed the ukrainian military remaining in mariupol then there would be no negotiations on april  russia decided against storming the towns azovstal steel plant where the ukrainian troops are besieged moscow declared mariupol liberated on the same day zelensky said he does not rule out that the deblockading of mariupol could happen by military means zelensky acts as if this confrontation was a personal conflict between russias president vladimir putin and him without actually caring about ukraine dorsi insisted the comedianturnedpresident seems totally clueless to me not fit to cope with such a situation he added zelenskys frantic activeness which includes filming numerous videos and delivering video addresses with demands for help before lawmakers in the us eu and elsewhere could eventually backfire against him the journalist warned the ukrainian leader has been asking the west for weapons deliveries financial and humanitarian aid increased sanctions pressure on russia and eu membership for his country however many of his requests remain unfulfilled including a demand to close ukraines skies to russian planes which is almost certain to provoke a conflict between moscow and nato dorsi also insisted that use of the word genocide by zelensky to describe the events in ukraine was unacceptable he is jewish but the ukrainian leader shouldnt forget that neonazis are now supporting his government he said its really a paradox when one speaks about genocide to justify ones own policies forgetting that hes backed by the descendants of the very people who persecuted the jews in the  and  the journalist pointed out russia attacked the neighboring state in late february following ukraines failure to implement the terms of the minsk agreements first signed in  and moscows eventual recognition of the donbass republics of donetsk and lugansk the german and french brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the ukrainian state the kremlin has since demanded that ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country

and meet criteria including benefitting the community working collaboratively incorporating conservation practices and educating the public so while much of this is true it should be noted that it has zero to do with the federal government and would be best dealt with by individuals in their own community in fact not only is there a push for individuals to garden now more than ever but there is talk of building community through things like grand jury militia and community gardens the usda has this to say about naming the peoples garden the peoples garden was named in honor of usdas founder

has been authorized to do any of this let alone keeping americans healthy in fact the usda does quite the opposite allowing genetically modified organisms hormones pumped into animals and terrible upkeep of many animals that will be sold to consumers for food agorist writes again it is important to point out that the mission statement of the usda does not involve anything to do with keeping americans healthy in fact their track record over the years has done the complete opposite case in point in december  a scientific committee composed of  academics and doctors recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to  of daily calories from  in the current guidelines the group compiled a massive trove of data and presented this request to the usda citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like type  diabetes heart disease and cancer to be clear you need absolutely  of your diet to be comprised of sugar but this panel seemingly knew the usda  who hands out billions of taxpayer dollars to companies who specialize in addicting americans to sugar  would never get behind a recommendation against all sugar so they offered a slight concession this scientific committee asked for a measly  drop in the usdas recommended sugar intake in foods  providing  pages of evidence showing the horrifying effects it is having on children and adults  and the usda refused the new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol brandon lipps deputy undersecretary for food nutrition and consumer services at the usda told the wall street journal at the time in december of  it was clear that excessive sugar intake was connected to comorbidities like heart disease type  diabetes and obesity  all of which drastically increased complications from a  infection yet the usda  who pretends to care about your health  refused to budge in the slightest now this same organization is claiming that it wants you to register your vegetable garden so it can place you in a database and put your healthy food source on a map  for your health of course you also get a cool sign for your front yard too while a handful of folks inside the usda may have wellmeaning intentions behind this program the behemoth organizations track record and history clearly indicate that the overwhelming majority of them do not care about your health not only do they not care about your health but most of their farm and food budget goes toward subsidizing products that directly harm your health so skepticism over a national garden database run by this organization is entirely warranted as the world teeters on the verge of nuclear war and economic

street thugs from north africa from an islamic country sam van rooy also the party leader of antwerp city council urged the mayor to address the migrant problem by increasing the police presence and number of arrests furthermore the judicial system refuses to impose penalties on migrants for their illegal behavior so i wish bart de wever mayor of antwerp would take care of it that his police would be put in greater force an additional problem is that when these young rascals are arrested which doesnt happen very often unfortunately they are immediately set free so the leniency is enormous

about rights has been seen as a thinly veiled swipe at the us supreme courts ruling to overturn roe v wade which was a landmark decision conferring the right to have an abortion writer charlie peters in the spiked oped said prince harrys speech was full to the brim with many other unwanted and ignorant insights take for example his contention that constitutional rights are being rolled back in the

expected during the approaching winter heavilyindustrialized germany has been especially hard hit with more than half of all small and midsized businesses fearful that they might be forced to close an economic catastrophe of great depression proportions the only nearterm hope of salvation had been an end to the selfdestructive energy sanctions these countries had imposed upon russia which would have allowed plentiful and cheap russian natural gas to resume flowing through the russianowned nord stream pipelines although the european governments remained firmly opposed to that solution many ordinary europeans felt differently and in recent days large public demonstrations in germany and the czech republic had demanded that the sanctions be lifted there was widespread speculation that such popular protests would eventually carry the day if not immediately then once winter hardship became too severe the outcome would be a negotiated end to the ukraine war along the general lines suggested by russia resulting in a strategic defeat for america and nato thousands of people in gera in germany against olaf scholzs policy and the explosion of energy and gas prices they demand an end to sanctions on russia and the reopening of the nord stream  gas pipeline demonstrations also in other german cities but eu media censors them  then on september  this geopolitical landscape was upended as a series of large explosions severely damaged the huge russian pipelines putting them out of commission indefinitely probably even permanently with the pipelines no longer operational europe would have to make due with the limited supply of american gas that can be shipped by tanker at a cost many times greater the massive explosive attacks on the undersea pipelinesrather euphemistically characterized as sabotage in the media headlineshad occurred near the coastal waters of denmark and sweden in an area of the baltic heavily monitored and patrolled by nato warships given these simple undeniable facts the likely suspects were rather obvious but they still remained almost completely unmentionable in the western media coverage instead the washington post hometown newspaper of the american government ran an article with the headline european leaders blame russian sabotage after nord stream explosions quoting a long list of anonymous government sources making that nonsensical claim which was widely echoed across most western media outlets our political elites apparently assumed that their tight media control will ensure that their ignorant citizenry could be made to believeor at least pretend to believealmost anything even that the russians had destroyed their own pipelines but public media statements do not necessarily reflect private beliefs prominent neocon journalist anne applebaum had spent years on the editorial board of the washington post and her husband is radek sikorski polands former foreign and defense minister and someone with the strongest possible ties to the americas political and national security establishment twitter allows individuals to casually blurt out statements that they may later regret and the day after the pipeline explosions he issued a series of tweets celebrating the attacks including one showing a photo of the resulting destruction with the telling caption thank you usa that last tweet soon went superviral with some  retweets and  likes leading him to quickly delete it someone else on twitter shrewdly described that desperate backpedaling after the us destroyed the pipelines there was radio silence as the regime was trying to determine their narrative this delay caused a polish official to publicly thank the us for the attack then word went out yesterday to deny the attack the nato propaganda bots are out given the nearunanimous media drumbeat that the russians had destroyed their own multibilliondollar pipelines presumably because of their evil insanity its quite possible that a majority perhaps even a large majority of our citizens will blandly accept that story just as they have so many other equally ridiculous concoctions of the past but i would think that nearly all our elites who are paying any attention to the issue strongly suspect or even flatly assume that elements of the american government played a central role in the attacks though almost none of them would publicly admit such a thing one of the tiny handful of brave exceptions to this enforced silence and perhaps the only such individual with a large media platform was tucker carlson and a couple of days after the attack he broadcast a segment on the topic to his audience of millions he noted that although it might seem unimaginable that the american government would commit such an act of international terrorism as illegally destroying pipelines so important to europes industrial economy perhaps that might be what actually happened among other things he showed clips of both president joe biden and assistant secretary of state victoria nuland explicitly threatening to eliminate the nord stream pipelines if a russiaukraine broke out biden admits us behind sabotage of nordstream  and  biden if russia invadesthen there will be no longer a nord stream  reporter but how will you do that its in germanys control biden i promise you we will be able to do that victoria nuland if russia invades ukraine one way or another nord stream  will not move forward also this is the same victoria nuland who said fuck the eu and she sure did it to you germany and immediately following the attacks secretary of state antony blinken mentioned that the bombing would greatly benefit american interests offering our country tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come according to secblinken the nord stream pipeline bombing offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come too bad that this tremendous opportunity for dc bureaucrats will come at the expense of everyone else especially this coming winter despite his past public statements i tend to doubt that biden himself had played any role in the decisionmaking process or that he was even personally informed of the planned attack he is merely a figurehead an elderly nonentity who generally says whatever he is told to say but he has also become notorious for making public statements that his horrified subordinates must immediately clarify and that would have been an obvious risk in this situation so to the extent that our president is even aware that europes largest energy pipelines were attacked and severely damaged its quite possible that he is in that small minority of highranking individuals who has no idea of who may have been responsible or even blames it on the russians because his handlers have told him so the vacuum left by an almost entirely dishonest or timorous media has been filled by a handful of courageous independent bloggers with moon of alabama and john helmer probably providing some of the best early analysis of what had probably happened  the war on germany just entered its hot phase  the bornholm blowup repeats the bornholm bashpoland attacks germany and blames russia  whodunnit  facts related to the sabotage attack on the nord stream pipelines the particular details of the attacks have relatively little importance and the early speculation has gone in several directions the theory advanced by helmer a longtime american correspondent based in moscow is that the actual operation was carried out by polish forces with americas intelligence and technical support this seems quite plausible since poland has been fiercely hostile to russia and the russian pipelines which would annually cost the country many hundreds of millions of dollars in lost future pipeline transit fees the poles had made every possible effort to block the nord stream project and polands nearby coast would provide an ideal staging ground for the attack moreover by an astonishing coincidence the attack occurred exactly as poland had opened a much smaller pipeline allowing it to supply its own energy needs from norway completely independent of nord stream but whether or not the operation was carried out by polish proxies or even ukrainians those local allies are totally dependent upon our goodwill for their survival and it is inconceivable that they would have taken this momentous step without the approval and supervision of powerful elements of the american national security establishment so debating who actually planted the explosives is merely a red herring despite the lack of any hard evidence the likelihood that america played a central role in the attacks seems a nearcertainty means motive and opportunity all point so strongly in a single direction that i doubt that there are too many rational intelligent individuals who sincerely believe otherwise although for obvious reasons they may mouth deceptive evasions or choose to keep silent yet virtually no one in the major media is willing to recognize this obvious reality and this disingenuous reaction has even extended to large segments of the supposedly fearless alternative media although these enormously important attacks reached the front pages of the new york times and the wall street journal not a word about them appeared in counterpunch the nation or the new republic and barely any mention at antiwarcom presumably for fear that their pieces would necessarily have to mention the prime suspect various internet pundits have promoted the most absurd alternate possibilities in order to avoid fingering the american government this widespread see no evil response is illustrated by a popular internet meme let us step back and place this incident in its proper historical context recognizing the astonishing recklessness we are not currently at war with russia let alone germany and a  billion energy project important to both those countries has been wrecked with a potentially devastating impact upon the european economy not only is this probably the greatest peacetime military attack upon civilian infrastructure in world history but if we exclude the  attacksofficially ascribed to a nonstate terrorist organizationnothing even remotely comparable comes to mind consider the obvious possibility of retaliation russia possesses a very powerful and sophisticated military with excellent special forces and the wests own energy infrastructure is woefully vulnerable and unprotected moreover our heavily financialized economy might collapse like a house of cards if it were struck a tiny blow in the right location with tucker carlson noting that if russia merely cut the transatlantic fiberoptic cables connecting financial markets in the us and europe wall street would suffer gigantic losses but i think the greatest risk our country faces is an automatic consequence of our attacks on europes critical energy infrastructure even absent any significant russian reprisals if germany and the rest of europe undergo an economic collapse the american economy can hardly avoid severe damage as well but i think the more important impact will be upon the longerterm geopolitical alignment of that continent europeans will suffer greatly this winter and despite the solid wall of media propaganda more and more of them may begin to recognize the architect of their distress for nearly three generations our nato allies have constituted a crucial element of americas global military and economic power and if they see their repayment as being a treacherous criminal attack with devastating consequences they may eventually decide to shift their allegiance in a different direction the hashtag kriegserklaerungdeclaration of warwas recently trending for several days on twitter with numerous germans saying that america had declared war against their country overwhelming control over electronic and social media represents a powerful brainwashing tool but at some point its effectiveness may be overwhelmed by miserable reality the old soviet union never inflicted such deliberate suffering upon its warsaw pact vassals and that alliance collapsed in  so if some of the more dismal economic predictions for europe are realized i wonder if nato will long survive from a broader perspective industrialized germany and resourcerich russia are natural trading partners and as mike whitney so presciently argued back in february much of americas recent european strategy has been aimed at blocking their growing economic ties our destruction of the nord stream pipelines may have temporarily prevented any immediate german defection but the bitterness we will have earned may be even more significant in the future if germany shifted its political ties eastward americas power in europe would be shattered and german voters do have a say in such matters especially if they begin to suffer depressionlike conditions in the next few months the establishment of a fullfledged russiangerman alliance would completely reshape the geopolitics of eurasia but i suspect that our ignorant government leaders would dismiss such a possibility as an absurd fantasy given what they imagine is the deep traditional hostility between those two populations however as i explained a few years ago this is completely incorrect being based upon an extremely skewed misreading of european history in my unjustified arrogance i also sometimes relished a sense of seeing obvious things that magazine or newspaper journalists got so completely wrong mistakes which often slipped into historical narratives as well for example discussions of the titanic  century military struggles between germany and russia quite often made casual references to the traditional hostility between those two great peoples who for centuries had stood as bitter rivals representing the eternal struggle of slav against teuton for dominion over eastern europe although the bloodstained history of the two world wars made that notion seem obvious it was factually mistaken prior to  those two nationalities had not fought against each other for the previous  years and even the seven years war of the  century had involved a russian alliance with germanic austria against germanic prussia hardly amounting to a conflict along civilizational lines russians and germans had been staunch allies during the endless napoleonic wars and closely cooperated during the metternich and bismarck eras that followed while even as late as  germany had supported russia in its unsuccessful war against japan during the  weimar germany and soviet russia had a period of close military cooperation the hitlerstalin pact of  marked the beginning of the second world war and throughout the long cold war the ussr had no more loyal a satellite than east germany perhaps two dozen years of hostility over the last three centuries with good relations or even ou tright alliance during most of the remainder hardly suggested that russians and germans were hereditary enemies moreover during much of that period russias ruling elite had had a considerable germanic tinge russias legendary catherine the great had been a german princess by birth and over the centuries so many russian rulers had taken german wives that the later czars of the romanov dynasty were usually more german than russian russia itself had a substantial but heavily assimilated german population which was very well represented in elite political circles with german names being quite common among government ministers and sometimes found among important military commanders even a top leader of the decembrist revolt of the early  century had had german ancestry but was a zealous russiannationalist in his ideology if the looming economic calamity does eventually shift germany to a russian alliance the american attacks on the nord stream pipelines will be remembered as the blow that altered the entire trajectory of global politics to this point most readers will probably be nodding their heads at the factual observations i have made even if they doubt some of the suggested possible consequences perhaps americas destruction of europes energy pipelines and the resulting economic devastation of germany will lead to a permanent rupture in the western alliance or perhaps not the future is difficult to predict but although there is not a single shred of hard evidence indicating american involvement the circumstantial case is so overwhelmingly strong that no sensible person can come to any other conclusion whether or not we acted through local proxies our government was clearly responsible for the destruction of europes most important energy infrastructure an act of absolutely colossal criminality and recklessness which may have enormously negative consequences for our own national interests virtually all western mainstream media outlets and many alternative ones may scrupulously avoid this reality and paid propagandists may energetically dispute it but it remains the obvious truth and heres the rub this entire scenario seems remarkably similar to another that i have advanced over the last couple of years on an entirely different topic beginning in april  i have published a long series of articles arguing that the global covid epidemic was the result of an american biowarfare attack against china and iran just as with president biden donald trump himself was similarly out of the loop but the attack was probably orchestrated by top figures in his administration who immediately tried somewhat successfully to blame the chinese for the viral epidemic that began in their own country once again virtually all of the relevant facts have been ignored by the western media but can easily be found and connected together and once again the weight of circumstantial evidence seems overwhelming indeed in many respects far stronger than that for the pipeline attacks during the thirty months i have been making this case the only strong argument ever presented against it was the claim that not even rogue elements of the trump administration could have been so reckless as to launch a biowarfare attack an attack whose unintended blowback eventually killed over a million americans and disrupted the lives of billions worldwide but our destruction of europes most crucial energy infrastructure demonstrates the true depths of the criminal recklessness sometimes found in the american government once individuals have fully absorbed the broader implications of the nord stream attacks including the widespread but ridiculous media claims that the russians destroyed their own pipelines they should reassess their assumptions regarding american governmental behavior and also reexamine the circumstances of the covid outbreak with a fresh eye in particular they should note the strikingly clear evidence of american foreknowledge of the outbreak which can be summarized in just a few hundred words for example in  trump brought in robert kadlec who since the  had been one of americas leading biowarfare advocates the following year in  a mysterious viral epidemic hit chinas poultry industry and in  another mysterious viral epidemic devastated chinas pork industry from the earliest days of the administration leading trump officials had regarded china as americas most formidable geopolitical adversary and orchestrated a policy of confrontation then from january to august  kadlecs department ran the crimson contagion simulation exercise involving the hypothetical outbreak of a dangerous respiratory viral disease in china which eventually spreads into the united states with the participants focusing on the necessary measures to control it in this country as one of americas foremost biowarfare experts kadlec had emphasized the unique effectiveness of bioweapons as far back as the late  and we must commend him for his considerable prescience in having organized a major viral epidemic exercise in  that was so remarkably similar to what actually began in the real world just a few months later with leading trump officials greatly enamored of biowarfare fiercely hostile to china and running largescale  simulations on the consequences of a mysterious viral outbreak in that country it seems entirely unreasonable to completely disregard the possibility that such extremely reckless plans may have been privately discussed and eventually implemented though probably without presidential authorization but with the horrific consequences of our own later governmental inaction being obvious elements within our intelligence agencies have sought to demonstrate that they were not the ones asleep at the switch earlier this month an abc news story cited four separate government sources to reveal that as far back as late november a special medical intelligence unit within our defense intelligence agency had produced a report warning that an outofcontrol disease epidemic was occurring in the wuhan area of china and widely distributed that document throughout the top ranks of our government warning that steps should be taken to protect us forces based in asia after the story aired a pentagon spokesman officially denied the existence of that november report while various other top level government and intelligence officials refused to comment but a few days later israeli television mentioned that in november american intelligence had indeed shared such a report on the wuhan disease outbreak with its nato and israeli allies thus seeming to independently confirm the complete accuracy of the original abc news story and its several government sources it therefore appears that elements of the defense intelligence agency were aware of the deadly viral outbreak in wuhan more than a month before any officials in the chinese government itself unless our intelligence agencies have pioneered the technology of precognition i think this may have happened for the same reason that arsonists have the earliest knowledge of future fires according to these multiplysourced mainstream media accounts by the second week of november our defense intelligence agency was already preparing a secret report warning of a cataclysmic disease outbreak taking place in wuhan yet at that point probably no more than a couple of dozen individuals had been infected in that city of  million with few of those yet having any serious symptoms the implications are rather obvious furthermore as the coronavirus gradually began to spread beyond chinas own borders another development occurred that greatly multiplied my suspicions most of these early cases had occurred exactly where one might expect among the east asian countries bordering china but by late february iran had become the second epicenter of the global outbreak even more surprisingly its political elites had been especially hardhit with a full  of the entire iranian parliament soon infected and at least a dozen of its officials and politicians dying of the disease including some who were quite senior indeed neocon activists on twitter began gleefully noting that their hated iranian enemies were now dropping like flies let us consider the implications of these facts across the entire world the only political elites that have yet suffered any significant human losses have been those of iran and they died at a very early stage before significant outbreaks had even occurred almost anywhere else in the world outside china thus we have america assassinating irans top military commander on jan  and then just a few weeks later large portions of the iranian ruling elites became infected by a mysterious and deadly new virus with many of them soon dying as a consequence could any rational individual possibly regard this as a mere coincidence the iranians themselves were well aware of these facts and their top political and military leaders publicly accused america of an illegal biowarfare attack against their own country and china with their former president even filing an official protest with the united nations but although these explosive charges were widely reported in the iranian press they were completely ignored by the american media so that almost no americans ever became aware of them"}, {"id": "3113",

see a whole lot more than the protests weve seen to date yes things can get worse that said the catalyst for europes farmers rising up was the crazy miscalculation of davos minions truedoh and his ukrainian diaspora bagwoman chrystia freeland freezing the accounts of truckers and trampling peaceful protestors with horses woke way too many people up when you anger the banks radicalize normies and create a nationwide bank run you set a countdown timer on your rule first they came for the truckers to engineer a supply crisis people supported them in droves and were trampled now they came for the dutch farmland to further engineer a food crisis and the farmers took up the truckers flag the dutch farmers that are fighting against the government didnt erect a flag of the netherlands in their square but a canadian flag  an unstoppable movement was started in canada  for weeks ive wondered whether the spate of fires at food processing facilities all across north america were sabotage or just the natural downstream effect of overworked people and undermaintained equipment its a fair point to consider rather then just go off halfcocked about evils of davos because in the end it doesnt matter what the truth is likely a mixture of both these breakdowns are all their fault anyway thank that idiotic covid policy but how about fertilizer train derailments or a thousand dead cows from heat prostration when the farmers revolution began in the netherlands i realized this was something deeper and i was glad for it the great awakening that began in ottawa and spread worldwide then has metastasized into a real political nightmare for klaus schwab and his merry gang of nihilist midwits you know they are on autopilot seizing the land of efficient dutch farmers the netherlands is routinely praised by davos as a kind of sustainable agriculture mecca so why go after them why not further demonize american farmers i mean everyone just knows americans are wasteful and dirty pigs right and then i came across the plans for tristate city and for me it all clicked into place bankrupt the farmers through legislative fiat and seize their land to build the davos smart city of the future the perfect capitol of the corporatocracy try googling anything about this connection and youll find very little look at a twitter search of tristate city and come to your own conclusions think minority report but with germans periodic revolution davos war against the periodic table continues unabated but notice how they arent going after truly poisonous elements like mercury hg or thallium

article on what putin may or may not do please consider what are the odds emphasis mine i have received a number of emails over the last few days from correspondents who assert that the risk of a nuclear war was small or that it was unlikely it is worth reflecting on the meaning of these predictions in detail what does unlikely mean when we are talking about a nuclear war i can translate it for you it means i have no clue but i have a feeling that feeling is based on assumptions that may sound plausible but that we cannot be sure of we think we know what vladimir putin considers to be in his strategic interest we think some brave soul in the russian command structure would heroically refuse to comply with a presidential nuclear launch order we may think that these weapons are as dysfunctional as russias tanks that they explode at launch or midair or we think that there might be a coup against him before he has the opportunity to pull the trigger we can assert the probability of an earthquake and attach a number to it but there is no way we can do this here we have no data and no probability distribution and the usual weasel words are not helping us either all we have is intelligence from public sources and from our security services they may have information about whether somebody is plotting against putin or whether putin faces internal opposition but we have to treat such information professionally remember the weapons of mass destruction debacle back then many western governments did not apply the highest standards of verification we must ask ourselves is the source reliable is there a second source is there further corroboration do the sources have an agenda that may cause them to distort the truth or lie our western thinking about risk is rooted in the modern concept of probability developed by the great russian mathematician andrey kolmogorov in the  probability and statistics allow us to calculate the numeric probability of an earthquake or help us with economic forecasts but this framework is not useful here right now it is best to think not of quantifiable risk but of unquantifiable uncertainty there are clearly scenarios that speak against russias use of nuclear weapons but i can think of two where the bomb goes off in the end the first is one where putin realises that he lost the war where he knows he will not personally survive and where he decides to take the western european enemy down with him what speaks against this scenario is that russias elite might frustrate this they clearly have no desire to perish in a nuclear holocaust it is possible that my scenario wont happen then again a lastminute intervention by the generals and the oligarchs may not happen or it happens and fails or happens succeeds but comes too late lets us not pretend that we are in a position to write the ending of this particular hollywood script in my second scenario putin calculates that the launch of a smallish tactical nuclear weapon in ukraine would split the western alliance in particular it would break the bidenscholz axis i have been arguing from the start of the war that the germans are the weak link in the western alliance putin knows that too and he might conclude that this is his most effective weapon m\u00fcnchau says he cannot assign a probability to his scenarios but no one else can either and that is his point i cant help but fixate on do the sources have an agenda that may cause them to distort the truth or lie there is no reason to trust what anyone says the us state department lost whatever trust it had in the weapons of mass destruction fiasco colin powel aided president bushs agenda with a remarkable speech to the un that anyone with an ounce of common sense knew was a lie it is a

minister bloomberg reported chinese analysts said that britain being surpassed by its former colony in terms of economy is a symbolic incident that proves the uk is declining badly and being further marginalized in europe this also shows that londons policy that closely follows us to serve washingtons strategy in dealing with other major powers like the eu russia and china is bringing no concrete benefit to britain and it also cant stop the uks postbrexit mess from worsening truss is likely to face the most challenging set of circumstances of any prime minister since margaret thatcher said the times on monday the biggest issue for the new prime minister is the cost of living crisis and truss looks set to respond by ripping up  years of economic orthodoxy soaring inflation energy bills and the price of food have prompted warnings of households going cold and hungry this winter said the times report the current unprecedented shambles resulted from a series of negative incidents including brexit the  pandemic and the ukraine crisis and are extremely challenging for any new leader to solve wang shuo a professor at the school of international relations of beijing foreign studies university told the global times on monday wang said truss hawkish language on china during the campaign came from the fact that truss perfectly knew that she is not capable to solve uks domestic problems such as inflation or the energy crisis shirking ones responsibility is the simplest and most effective way for an incompetent politician by blaming and criticizing china and russia harshly just as what truss always does it is actually saying all the problems we have in the uk are the fault of china and russia instead of the inability of the countrys governors wang pointed out yin zhiguang a professor at the school of international relations and public affairs under fudan university told the global times on monday that the conservative party is impossible to review or reform the current development model so the new prime minister will likely use political approaches to solve economic problems truss idea of tax cut is actually unrealistic especially when the economy is declining under multiple challenges like inflation and energy crisis how to get money will be the key problem for the new government yin said apart from seeking opportunities from involving in the russiaukraine conflict london would further strengthen the transatlantic alliance with the us to seek possibilities of solving economic problems from making the uk a stronghold for washington to involve the issues in europe and asia yin said based on the difficulties that the uk is facing now and the performance of truss in the past when she served in other positions in the british government the international community whether in the western or nonwestern world share concerns over the change she could bring to the uk us media politico said earlier on august  that more than a dozen conversations with senior diplomats and insiders from power centers around the world suggest truss is not exactly a popular choice on the global stage truss will be met with deep skepticism across much of western europe and within the biden administration because her stance in handling postbrexit trade ties with europe and her sponsorship of the northern ireland protocol bill could impact the hardwon peace in ireland said politico china is also concerned about the potential changes that might be brought by the new uk government since truss could appoint some extreme antichina politicians to handle foreign affairs and national security so under pressure from the us london could be more assertive in decoupling with china and use hong kong or xinjiang as pretexts to suspend or cut off existing cooperation yin said if a hostile policy toward china has been implemented by truss it serves the interest of truss herself rather than the uk cui hongjian director of the department of european studies at the china institute of international studies told the global times on monday in order to please not only washington but also the sick political correctness of antichina and antirussia stance spreading across the western world truss is very likely to politically and diplomatically take a tough stance toward china in the short term due to her dubious governing capacity cui said but in the long run after some frictions truss may learn to be pragmatic and return to a balanced position just as what her predecessors theresa may and boris johnson did in handling ties with china  being tough on diplomatic and political fronts but maintaining trade and economic cooperation cui noted wang echoed that as long as doing business with china can bring benefits to the capitalists of the uk the countrys cooperation with china will be unstoppable so the key is not about whether uk politicians like china or not its about whether the cooperation is beneficial"}, {"id":

and gave hollingsworth the boot the unemployed  who has never lived on his own was clearly distressed when i spoke with him wednesday shes destroyed my life he exclaimed bitterly staring at the photo in his clenched fist a photograph of his family during happier times duane has  younger siblings who have since gone on with their lives and become successful driven adults but duanes life just never seemed to take off he remained content with frittering away his days playing video games and watching anime cartoons things that are mostly enjoyed by children duane is an adult male who just absolutely refuses to grow up after the death of duanes father  years ago his mother janice gave him an ultimatum either get a fulltime job enroll in college or find somewhere else to live after a handful of paltry attempts to secure employment at various fastfood establishments it was clear that duane would rather spend his time nestled among my little pony figurines in a musky basement than actually work for a living it was clear he wasnt serious about making a living for himself janice explained he always had some excuse and frankly all these excuses were wearing very thin i just wanted him out so i could enjoy retirement after having lost my husband he was becoming an enormous financial burden and didnt seem to care duane wouldnt budge he would frequently lash out and blame his siblings and myself for his lot in life eventually the moment of reckoning finally arrived in january of this year janice gave duane  days to find somewhere else to live it was  days of pure hell he stormed around the house screaming and crying i could not believe what a spoiled brat he was at  years years of age he always resented me for having more children after he was born i suppose he just

by selling off his vintage action figures and other collectibles on ebay and pawning items for loans at eksperten he has also began taking steps to sue his own mother for damages pain and suffering

sweatpants and a threadbare power rangers tshirt which was clearly too small for his hulking frame my mother is going to pay for kicking me out i had squatters rights that was my lifelong home and my mother did nothing but torture me the whole time i was there my parents neglected me when my other siblings were born so i totally deserve to stay there as long as i want nobody knows the hell i have endured when questioned about the impending lawsuit being served up by her own son janice just shakes her head he only has himself to blame for his situation and obviously hes going to lose our only

nuclear power to achieve true energy security editors note we endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives below is a column arguing that the us must fully embrace nuclear power to achieve energy security you can find a counterpoint here where steve milloy argues that the us should unleash its full fossil fuel potential to achieve energy independence the outcome of russias brutal attempt to conquer the valiant nation of ukraine hangs in the balance but it is not too soon to discuss strategic steps that we can and should take based on this stark reminder that other countries do not always play nice energy has an outsized role in the russiaukraine war the sale of russian oil and gas has financed the kremlin and its  years of aggressions against its neighbors and its own people european democracies are addicted to russias hydrocarbons and it will take years to break them of their dependency to its credit europe finally seems to be waking up to the menace posed by the unpredictable bear next door the key takeaway is that energy security is not to be taken for granted some european countries germany belgium and spain plan to or are in the process of shutting down nuclear power plants to assuage the green party they are left with intermittent renewable power backed up by burning coal and natural gas which emit large quantities of the very greenhouse gases those countries seek to avoid unwisely they rely on russia for much of their oil and gas which puts those european countries in a vulnerable situation when the bear acts up in contrast america is blessed with abundant coal oil and natural gas thanks in large part to the shale gas revolution renewable electricity generation continues to grow rapidly adding to the diversity of electricity supply we are not overly reliant on any single foreign power for our energy can we not just continue to do what we have been doing unfortunately no being in a good place today is not the same as being in a good place  years down the road there is an undeniable need to transition to clean energy sources moreover americas supply of hydrocarbons while ample for current needs is inherently finite burning oil and gas to make electricity today is hardly the best strategic use of our resources we should conserve those hydrocarbons for applications like petrochemicals and certain kinds of transportation like air travel subsidized electricity generation from wind and solar power has grown tremendously over the past two decades but even taken together wind and solar are still not the number one source of clean electricity in this country nuclear power is fortunately the united states is wellsituated to build on its solid foundation in nuclear energy to enable a clean and reliable energy future from its humble beginnings powering four light bulbs near arco idaho in  nuclear power has become the baseload electricity workhorse in many parts of the country today  nuclear power reactors provide approximately  of the countrys electricity the plants operate around the clock and all year long to produce power when americans need it without harmful emissions unlike renewable energy nuclear power plants run when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing from a security perspective nuclear power plants run  months between refueling and they can store years of fresh fuel on site making them resistant to transportation bottlenecks and shortterm supply interruptions uranium for nuclear fuel is plentiful and available domestically as well as from stable reliable allies most notably canada and australia thats the situation today but what about the future two stateoftheart large light water reactors are nearing completion in georgia and private industry and the government are funding research development and deployment of exciting new advanced reactor designs that incorporate inherent safety features and additional capabilities beyond those of current reactors many will operate at high temperatures that enable more efficient electricity production those high temperatures also support essential nonelectricity industrial applications such as process steam for industry and hydrogen production this opens up the possibility of decarbonizing industry as well as electricity new designs are also better suited for meshing with variable wind and solar generation thereby helping to mitigate grid reliability concerns the nuscale small modular reactor already received design certification approval from the us nuclear regulatory commission applications for a number of other designs will be under nrc review shortly we look forward to deployments of new advanced reactors beginning later this decade all sources of energy have their advantages and disadvantages the need to transition to clean energy is evident and all technologies  including nuclear renewables fossil with carbon capture and hydroelectric  should be deployed where feasible and economic the nuclear technology world seeks a level playing field without subsidies for favored sources and with appropriate monetization for essential attributes like security reliability avoided emissions and the ability to provide generation when needed there is no substitute for plentiful and affordable energy and we need to make smart

speculated about with fervour the russian military leadership is alternately accused of incompetence or brutality and every report from kiev that signals a new putin debacle is spread without hesitation this has already aroused the mistaken hope among some contemporaries in the west that the ukrainian comedian and his followers are well on the way to a victorious peace over the invaders there is a pronounced multimediasupported lack of interest in ukrainian military victims even though they are supposedly allowing themselves to be shot dead or invalided for our western values for freedom and democracy therefore not a word has been written about the latest bloody kiev disaster in the failed recapture of the strategically important snake island in the black sea off odessa or the fact that more and more completely inadequately militarily trained conscripted ukrainians and mercenaries are being sent to the eastern front as cannon fodder to make up for the large crew losses there the total lack of empathy of the valuebased west with the real suffering and dying ukrainian soldiers is nothing short of scandalous and profoundly inhumane as little as there was real interest in the west in the corrupt state of ukraine before the war so little interest is there now in the men who are now not only fighting for the independence of their country with weapons but are supposed

vaccines and accidentally became infected birx claims that communist china is responsible for initially covering up how infectious covid really was  she still apparently believes that the only way to know who really has covid since it is not always obvious is to test people for it using fraudulent pcr testing schemes china was implying that they were containing it but asymptomatic spread cannot be contained without testing birx contends according to birx covid came out of the box ready to infect when it first appeared in the chinese city of wuhan back in december  normally it would take years for a disease like to become infectious she insists but this one was immediately ready to go it happens birx says labs arent perfect people arent perfect we make mistakes and there can be contamination in other words it was all just an accident according to birx  nothing was intentional and the plandemic tyranny that resulted was all just a normal response that was not planned in advance at globalist gatherings such as event  birx is trying to cover for herself fauci and other plandemic coconspirators keep in mind that birx and her kind initially denied the idea that covid could have come from a lab insisting that it magically appeared in bat soup at a wet market in wuhan after that narrative failed these same folks suddenly agreed that covid could be labmade but that it was all just a big accident which is the narrative that birx is now running with someone working in the lab with one of the strains couldve caught it and not known they had it birx claims in laboratories you grow the virus in human cells allowing it to adapt more each time it passes through human cells it becomes more adapted nothing that she fauci or anyone else in the united states did in the aftermath of covids appearance was in any way wrong birx further contends in her mind china is totally to blame because they should have been testing for covid from the beginning i think the world lost several months of preparation because we were thinking there wasnt that level of humantohuman spread when there clearly was birx alleges china has repeatedly denied that covid leaked from a lab calling the idea a conspiracy theory and of course the communist regime denies any wrongdoing in how it handled the outbreak early on thenpresident donald trump suggested that covid was probably manufactured in a lab he was mocked for saying this by the likes of birx and others since that time trumps ideas have become more and more accepted especially as it becomes increasingly clear that the entire plandemic was planned by globalists both in the us and elsewhere  and birx is one such globalist it turns out that birxs sudden appearance on the world stage is all about grifting her new

however although theyre the ones with the most media exposure the truth is there are mercenaries from all around the world fighting for the regime and although international law outlaws mercenaries the ones fighting in ukraine arent just regular soldiers of fortune but also international terrorists previously operating in the middle east and africa even before russia intervened information on islamic terrorists fighting for the kiev regime was already common knowledge already in late february syrian intelligence services intercepted information that the turks were recruiting troops among the terrorist formations under their control to go fight in ukraine according to the information made public at the time turks formed and armed at least seven groups of about  terrorists in each which included members of terrorist groups such as hayat tahrir alsham hts harakat ahrar alsham alislamiyya and the islamic party of turkestan a few weeks later iraqi shia group ashab alkahf reported that military advisors from the countries of the antiisis coalition namely lithuania italy germany and the uk arrived in iraq to recruit mercenaries for the kiev regime forces two us bases ain elassad iraq and altanf syria were used as headquarters for this operation residents from syria iraq libya turkey tunisia sudan egypt jordan israel etc were given a chance to fight for democracy with priority given to specialists in largescale urban combat on march  the syrian ambassador to russia riyad haddad announced the threat of flooding ukraine with mercenaries and turning it into a big european

press bureau of the russian foreign intelligence service spoke about the transfer of isis soldiers to ukraine by the americans in midapril spokesman of the russian ministry of defense igor konashenkov stated that at that time and since the beginning of russias intervention at least  turkishbacked terrorists had arrived in ukraine this issue further ruined the already murky reputation of the kiev regime as its units were now composed of both neonazi and islamic terrorist troops its pretty clear why the kiev regime is trying to recruit anyone at this point simply put the motivation of regular ukrainians to fight for the regime is dwindling as their forces are suffering heavy casualties reaching the scale of  and not in their favor this is almost perfectly consistent with the scale of artillery supremacy of the russian forces which is also  just how desperate the kiev regime is to recruit troops for the donbass meat grinder can be seen in the fact that ukrainian men are now openly being abducted and pushed to the frontlines recently in transcarpathia ukraines westernmost region police were seen going to recreation centers including public pools trying to drag men out of the water and send them to military units and this doesnt only apply to ukrainian citizens but also to foreigners residing in ukraine including college students at the start of russias special military operation when foreigners were being evacuated including african expat students some were denied access to trains and buses while others were told they would be conscripted to the kiev regime forces an abc news journalist interviewed a congolese national who managed to escape this fate and who said we were told we will give you weapons and you will fight for ukraine i say eh will we fight for ukraine we are not ukrainians we are black how can we fight for ukraine on the other hand there were also mercenaries from some african countries such as nigeria who stated they wanted to fight for the kiev regime the regime promised to pay for their services and additional funds were sent to the ukrainian embassy in nigeria however in addition to evidence of military experience ukrainian diplomats demanded mercenaries pay  for a visa and a flight ticket promising a monthly salary of  dollars although they previously promised twice as much at the same time this is also considered a way for many to use the conflict as an excuse to reach europe what is certainly clear from all this chaos is that the political west seeks to dispose of terrorists and also use them against russian forces in this war to the last ukrainian in addition washington dc and london are profiting from all this in the longterm as mainland europe is bearing the brunt of the costs and consequences of their proxy war against russia many of the mercenaries and terrorists fighting for the kiev regime will certainly end up being europes problem provided they survive the conflict as already noted the kiev regime

vladimir putin is facing humiliation in ukraine after making the big mistake of provoking the democratic bear according to a war reporter john sweeney who has spent months reporting from kyiv said the russian president underestimated the ukrainians with his invasion and the former bbc journalist who charts putins rise to power in new book killer in the kremlin said he had absolutely no doubt ukraine will win if the west holds its nerve and keeps up support and weapons mr sweeney told expresscouk the great mistake hes made is to think that ukrainians would fall over and actually one of beautiful things about this terrible and stupid and brutal war is the idea that actually do not provoke the democratic bear and thats what putins done its a big mistake so long as the west holds its nerve then i think the ukrainians can beat them the russian armys spirits are low the ukrainian spirit is high they are defending their homes i believe the ukrainians can stop the killing machine push it back and that they can win mr sweeney who has reported from more than  countries during his career said one reason he believes russia will not succeed is because he has seen how corrupt moscow is he also said putin did not send enough manpower to fight his war in the face of fierce ukrainian resistance the journalist who has become known for wearing his lucky orange hat in kyiv said a humiliating defeat in ukraine would mark the beginning of the end for putin he said so i think the only way it can end is with ukrainian victory there is no other ending which is safe for the west we have to see the end of the putin regime and that is going to be accelerated by military victory any other outcome is a disaster for the west any compromise statemate thats a disaster our strategy has to be military defeat for the russian killing machine success for the ukrainians causing him to be humiliated and that humiliation causing the people around him to get rid of him the war reporter said the russian leaders grip on the kremlin was already weaker since launching his faltering assault on ukraine in february after failing in its original aim of taking capital city kyiv moscow has focused on pulverising parts of the east and south of the country mr sweeney said yes i think his position is much weaker tyrannies look strong then suddenly tomorrow bang theyre gone but i think that his control of the kremlins machinery is far weaker than it was before february  the journalist added that russian soldiers will eventually vote with their feet because they realise theyre fighting a pointless and stupid war for no good reason and the people who have sent them into battle have not sent them in with enough of the right stuff to deliver what they have to do amid speculation over putins health mr sweeney said his appearance has dramatically changed since he doorstepped him in  due to his puffylooking face he said i dont know the true state of vladimir putins health the reason i dont know that is because all the truth tellers in moscow have been shot poisoned had to flee the country or theyre in jail having said that when i saw him he looked like a weasel in the flesh and now he looks like a hamster and that according to doctors is evidence of steroid overuse or abuse on whether putin is mad or bad mr sweeney said he had spoken to ukrainian psychiatrist and former gulag prisoner semyon gluzman the journalist said he believes putin is not mad he doesnt have hallucinations he doesnt hear voices hes sane but bad you can be a psychopath and still sane or not mad this is good news because it means that he is a rational actor the fact that the russians made that rational decision to pull out of the battle of kyiv means that putin and his high command have some rationality i felt that the possibility of putin using nuclear weapons went away i dont think its a serious possibility mr sweeney whose book covers putin from his childhood in leningrad to his rise from kgb spy to leader said the russian presidents goal is the complete destruction of ukraine as an independent nation but he added ukrainians have taught us democracy must be defended free speech does not come for free there is also another reason which is that if the ukrainians go along with the russians then there is no more ukraine so they dont have an alternative they fight or their country is annihilated their country their culture everything they believe in so i feel theyre fighting because theyve got to fight but theyre also teaching us a lesson that democracy must be

discussions with legault during the pandemics first year the ties between qs and the government were so close that rankandfile members raised concerns that the party was being brought into disrepute the result of the pandemic policy supported by qs is that more than  people have died from  in the province and hundreds of thousands are likely to be affected by the potentially debilitating impacts of long covid qs has also played a key role in legitimizing the chauvinist turn the quebec ruling class has taken for over a decade with the aim of dividing workers along ethnic lines and scapegoating immigrants for the social crisis caused by capitalism this found expression under the legault government in a series of antidemocratic laws targeting immigrants and minorities qs voted in favour of

it would not make an issue of it in the election campaign on the economic front qs has boasted that it has put forward credible budget proposals including a timetable for balancing the provincial budget that is more ambitious than that set by the caq and the liberals while qs is forced to acknowledge the socioeconomic crisis affecting the vast majority of the populationdeepening economic insecurity and social inequality rampant inflation an acute housing crisis etcit has nothing serious to offer as it accepts the capitalist framework that are their cause all that is left of its previous already timid reform agenda are halfmeasures the party has abandoned more substantive proposals such as free public education at all levels which was the central demand of the massive  quebec

independence so as to establish a third imperialist state in north america its social composition based on the affluent middle class its opposition to the class struggle its quest for respectability within the establishmentall of this under conditions of global capitalist crisis has definitively exposed qu\u00e9bec solidaire as a rightwing nationalist party utterly hostile to the working class"},
